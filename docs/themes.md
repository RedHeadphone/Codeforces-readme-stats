With inbuilt themes, you can customize the look of the card without doing any [manual customization](./customization.md).

Use `&theme=THEME_NAME` parameter like so :

```md
![Codeforces Stats](https://codeforces-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/card?username=redheadphone&theme=radical)
```

### All inbuilt themes

Codeforces readme stats comes with several built-in themes (e.g. `dark`, `radical`, `merko`, `gruvbox`, `tokyonight`, `onedark`, `cobalt`, `synthwave`, `highcontrast`, `dracula`).

You can look at all available themes from the [theme config file](https://github.com/RedHeadphone/Codeforces-readme-stats/blob/master/src/themes.js) & **you can also contribute new themes** if you like :D
